# A Guide to Natural Language Processing Methods in Python (From Your Friendly Neighborhood Linguist)
This is a walkthrough of natural language processing basics in Python, working with an excerpt from a cookbook from 1889. You can read more background surrounding this project at the accompanying blog post on my website: https://shaynechammavanijakul.com/2020/08/12/a-guide-to-natural-language-processing-methods-in-python-from-your-friendly-neighborhood-linguist/

In this repository, you'll find the following materials:

## nlp_work
This is a resource demonstrating the concepts covered in the blog post: applications of natural language processing, cleaning and pre-processing text data: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming and lemmatization, data exploration: word frequency, data visualization (bar chart and wordcloud), lexical diversity and lexical density.

## cookbook_excerpt.txt
This is a brief excerpt from "The everyday cookbook and encyclopedia of practical recipes" (1889). (I'm an absolute sucker for vintage cookbooks, by the way, so I'll work with text there any chance I get!) This is the text data we experiment with in the nlp_work script.
